                            <p class="article">When you type begin again on the google bar and hit search the first result you'll see would be from Netflix, it'll say begin again is a romance and drama film directed by john Carney, along with a picture of Kiera knightly and mark ruffalo sitting on a car, so I thought it's a boy meets girl type of romance film, but after watching it I realized it is actually about a girl loosing something and then finding herself type of a story.  <br> The story is about a girl whose life is glued to her boyfriends life. they have been in a long term relationship, her boyfriend who is a singer has moved to new York as he is getting signed by a record company, and his  girlfriend Greta, is his companion who btw likes to write songs, from the very beginning we understand that her life revolves around her boyfriends life and she is okay with it, this story also portrays a partial protagonist, a music producer who once was the best in what he used to do but now is left with a career which is about a few inches from hitting the rock bottom, and also a broken marriage. The way these two stories are intertwined is shown adroitly.</p> <br>
                            <p class="article">Now as mentioned above this is not a review it's an appreciation of this beautiful film, and their are spoilers ahead,so do not go any further if you think you won't get any,(PS- cause you probably will)</p> <br>
                            <p class="article">Greta our main protagonist played by Kiera knightly is a character who is simple, humble and someone I would definately wanna be friends with, and her boyfriend who seems to be the same in the beginning of the film turns out to be a cheater, yes!, he cheats on his sweet long-term girlfriend with someone from the record company, and greta after discovering about this breaks down in tears, packs her bags and turns to a friend, her only friend in the city,her friend is a character who very naturally comes of as a modest and caring person, takes her out to a club type of a thing where Greta sings a rough song which she herself has written and composed. and then our partial protagonist, Dan played by Mark Ruffalo who clearly is very drunk enters the club, and hears <a href="https://youtu.be/sduYNx92_go" title="Video(Cc- jimmy box)" target="_blank">Greta singing</a> her song.</p>
                            
                            <img src="movies_images/begin again 2.webp" alt="" class="component-image">

                            <p class="article"> As a viewer i could see, when he looks at her he saw hope, a hope that maybe if he could get her signed by his record company  he'll be okay, maybe his career will be okay, and with that hope he approaches her after <a href="https://youtu.be/j7MZfgP3j7k" title="Video(cc-Lara Beatriz-Dev challenge)" target="_blank">her performance</a> and asks her if she's interested in getting signed to which she agrees after some hesitance, the two meet the next morning to get the business started, this is where their journey begins, this is where the story takes a deep dive into Dan's broken life and we go through Greta's post stages of break up, throughout the film their are multiple mesmerizing cinematic scenes, the scenes when they are assembling the musicians, recording songs out in the open, at random places in newyork makes me envy the city life and when the two of them wander in the city one night listening to songs from each others playlists, ahh the sense of calmness and those warm vibes are impeccable.</p>

                            <img src="movies_images/begin again 4.webp" alt="" class="component-image" style="width: 90%; height:auto;">
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            

                            <p class="article"> These two protagonists without having any idea are changing each others lives, making it better, In the end of the film greta takes a bicycle and rides away from her <a href="https://youtu.be/wKC4Ku5CVBE" title="Video(cc- unofficial media)" target="_blank">ex-boyfriend's concert</a> at that moment we  emphathize her feelings, she knows herself now, she found her own life, and she's living it. <br> Greta and Dan have a great chemistry between them, and their are multiple moments in the movie where we wish they could be more than friends, but then again that's not the point of beginning again,it's about self discovery and realization, on the other hand it's okay they don't end up together, I'll let you know why.</p>

                            <img src="movies_images/begin again 5.webp" alt="" class="component-image">

                            <p class="article">Their are films about which we can say, nothing should be replaced everything is perfect the way it is, begin again comes under this category. I believe this film has probably helped a lot of people going through break ups.<br> Great job John Carney for making these protagonists the way they are and also the other characters like, Greta's friend and Dan's daughter are represented in the most amazing way possible, it very easy to understand the depth of these characters and what they are, because they along with our protagonists share a sense of being relatable with the audience, in terms of the problems they face and the life they live. <br> So when you're watching this film, you are signing up for a great story with wonderful characters, beautiful moments of scenes and some real good music, give it a watch if you haven't already. </p>
